    <ul>
      <li className="writeup-p">XOR is a bitwise operation that outputs 1 when the bits being compared are different and 0 when they are the same.</li>
      <li className="writeup-p">a &oplus; a = 0 (where "&oplus;" is "^" in the code)  for any integer a. This property is critical because it means that when you XOR two identical numbers, the result is 0.</li>
      <li className="writeup-p">a &oplus; 0 = a (where "&oplus;" is "^" in the code) for any integer a, which means XORing a number with 0 does not change the number.</li>
    </ul>
      <p className='writeup-p'>XOR is both commutative and associative, meaning the order of operations does not matter. Thus, the sequence of XORing all the elements results in the cancellation of all the paired elements that appear twice, leaving the unique element (the one that appears only once) at the end.</p>

        <li className="writeup-p"><b>Time Complexity</b>: <i>O(n)</i>, the function iterates through the entire array exactly once, where <b>n</b> is the size of the array. ach XOR operation is constant time, so the overall time complexity is linear.</li>
        <li className="writeup-p"><b>Space Complexity</b>: <i>O(1)</i>.
